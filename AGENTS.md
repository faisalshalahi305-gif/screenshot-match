## Architecture rules
- Lesson content lives as one JSON block list in `lesson_content` (id 'main'); templates in `templates`. Why: the app has no sign-in, so all rows are shared and policy-limited.
- There is no AI template studio; templates are built in code (NovaFrames/NovaMore) and shown through the ➕ gallery. Why: the user removed the AI studio.
- Every block may carry an optional `fx` style layer (colors, light, shape, position, lock); merged/disassembled templates become a `group` block whose `children` are ordinary blocks/pieces. Why: one universal edit system for all templates with no x/y coordinates.
- All simulator planets (not only Earth) are real gravity bodies in `Sim.planets`, and Sun mass is a multiplier passed to every physics call. Why: Sun-mass presets must affect every planet consistently.
- The two-planet experiment is one sequence (`startRace`): gradual divergence, then the race from that same state, then a full stop at `RACE_END_S`. Why: the user merged the two twin options into one.
